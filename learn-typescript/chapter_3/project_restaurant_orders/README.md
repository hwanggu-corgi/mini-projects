# Restaurant Orders

Is fourth project for Codecademy's course `Learn Typescript`. This program builds on top
of previous project `Restaurant Recommender` that filters orders instead of restaurants.

This program uses array methods, functions, and practices writing clean code using `function types`.

## Setup Instruction

2. Type `tsc index.ts` in terminal to compile code
3. In the same folder, type `node index.js` to run program
